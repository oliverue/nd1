<p>Hello. I'm ND0 ("en-dee-zero").
<p>You're in the demo folder right now.
<br>I'd like to show you, what I can do.
<p>Tap each of the soft-keys to see a different demo.
<img src="SoftKeys.png" width="300" >
<p>After the demos, if you'd like my keys to look like this
<img src="../ClassicKeyPad.png" style='margin-left: 30px' width="230">
<p>or have the stack right-aligned like this
<img src="RightAligned.png" width="300" >
<p>go into the Settings app, find ND0, and set Configuration to "Classic" or Stack to "Right-Aligned".
<p>If you like this look
<img src="BlackKeyPad.png" width="300">
<p>tap the Definition tab and change my Skin to 'Dark'.
<p>The demos show cool stuff. I've been asked to tell you that I'm also "very happy to be a work-horse for everyday calculations like adding and dividing numbers (even non-complex ones)."
<p>Because I'm kinda different from others, to get expected behavior out of me, <b>please do the "Quick Tour"</b> at http://naivedesign.com/ND0, when you're done here.
You'll learn basics like moving between folders, using variables, taking screenshots, emailing your stack, how to enlarge my keys, and... how to do math without an Equals keys!
<p>If you need unlimited stack positions, please consider the purchase of ND1.
<p>
