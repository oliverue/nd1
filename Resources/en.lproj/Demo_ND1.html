<p>Hello. I'm ND1. Thank you for your purchase.
<p>You're in the demo folder right now.
<br>If you never saw the demos, I'd like to show you what I can do.
<p>Please tap each of the soft-keys in turn to see a different demo.

<p>If you're coming from ND0 and saw the demos already, you may just back out of this folder.
<p>Please: <b>do the "Quick Tour"</b> at http://naivedesign.com/ND1, to learn how to use me.
<br>The tour shows you basics like moving between folders, using variables, taking screenshots, emailing your stack, how to enlarge my keys, and, of course... how to calculate without an 'equals' key.
<p>
<p>By the way, if you like this look for my keys

<p>tap the Definition tab and change my Skin to 'Dark'.
<p>If you like the stack right-aligned like this

<p>go into the Settings app, find ND1, and set Stack to "Right-Aligned".
